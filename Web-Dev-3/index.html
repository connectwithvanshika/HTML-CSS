    <!-- SEO—short for search engine optimization—is about helping search engines understand your content, and helping users find your site and make a decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine. -->
    <!-- Cumulative Layout Shift - Unexpected layout shifts can disrupt the user experience in many ways, from causing them to lose their place while reading if the text moves suddenly, to making them click the wrong link or button. In some cases, this can do serious damage. -->
    <!-- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - is a metric that measures how long it takes for the main content of a web page to load, and is considered a key parameter of Core Web Vitals. It's important because it helps users perceive that a page is useful.  -->

        <p>1. SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
            The process of improving a website’s visibility in search engine results to increase organic traffic by
            optimizing content, keywords, and user experience.
        </p>

        <p>2. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):
            A metric that measures unexpected layout shifts on a webpage while loading. A low CLS means a stable layout,
            enhancing user experience.
        </p>

        <p>3. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):
            A metric that tracks how quickly the largest visible content element (e.g., image or text) loads. A faster
            LCP means the page becomes usable sooner.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. First Input Delay (FID): 
A metric that measures the time it takes for a webpage to respond to the first user interaction (e.g., clicking a link or button). A lower FID indicates a more responsive and user-friendly page. 

It helps evaluate how quickly users can start interacting with a website.
